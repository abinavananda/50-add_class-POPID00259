<h1>Class in HTML </h1>
  <p class="myClass">In HTML the class is not a standalone element or tag.Instead you use the class attribute within other HTML tags to assign one or more class names to elements. The class attribute is used to define a class or set of classes for an HTML element and it is often used with CSS to apply styles to those elements.</p>
  <div class="myClass"> It's important to note that the class attribute can be used with various HTML elements, and multiple classes can be applied to a single element by separating them with spaces.<br>&lt;div class="class1 class2 class3">This element has multiple classes.&lt;/div&gt;</div>
